# 🤖 AutoDev Lite: AI Code Writing Agent

AutoDev Lite is a lightweight AI-powered code generation and testing assistant built with [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It allows users to enter a coding task and see how three AI agents (Planner, Coder, and Tester) collaborate to generate, execute, and verify Python code.

- 🧠 **Task Planner Agent**: Breaks down your coding prompt into actionable steps.
- 💻 **Code Writer Agent**: Generates clean Python code based on the plan.
- 🧪 **Code Tester Agent**: Executes the code and returns output or error tracebacks.
